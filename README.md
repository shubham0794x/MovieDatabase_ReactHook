**the app will be able to search for movies via the OMDB API and render the results to the user. The reason for building the app is just so that we can get a better understanding of using hooks in an application, which helps in understanding the role some of the hooks we will use can play in your own real-world apps. Some things are needed before we get into building the app:e**

Node (â‰¥ 6)
A cool text Editor
An API key from OMDB (You can obtain it here or use mine)

** 


## Scripts

Install node modules

#### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# Deployment ðŸ“¦ 
- Once you have done with your setup and you have successfully completed all steps above, You need to put your website online!

- Now, we need to generate production build and deploy website.
  - ```npm run build``` command will generate the production build.
  - ```npm run deploy``` will create another branch called `gh-pages` and it will push the `build` files to that branch.
- The last step in deploying is to enable `Github Pages` in settings of the repository and select `gh-pages` branch.
- Now, your website is successfully deployed and you can visit it at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.
